## Week one

Going through my project idea as it stands it was not specific enough, as such I was suggested to make the idea more specific and streamline, I read related content as reaches so that the project can be narrowed down.

After reading the paperers I manged to get the project idea more narrowed down but still not narrowed down enough, as it still had too many ideas combined, so I needed to further narrow it down so I can get a project idea.

## Week two

I decided to change my proposal idea, as the idea in question might not have been that motivating to do as time passed than I previously thought it would.

As such I reaserched into something else the I could use as the new idea. Gating through some things I found an article about skills being improved with action video games, I diced that seamed interesting to do, and I gathered the background information for the new idea and created a second proposal.

The proposal I created was good but not pinpointed to my idea in specific areas of the proposal and wording, I also needed to remove and change around some text as it was placed in wrong area.

## Week three

I Added the changes that where suggested, extending the doc’s information by adding a begging paragraph, added more details to how the project will be more outlined, and fixed up the miner points. 

I was suggested to move a section that can go into another section, checked my spelling, add more references and link them back to what is beaning said.

## Week four

I wanted to get a better undertaking about few more things, regarding hand information and the things to consider when it came to reaction time and motor skills; and if anything, else that I could add to the current research I have. I found two different academic pappies, one looking more into motor skills and reaction time and the other regarding hand-to-hand information transfer related to befits in motor skills with repeated practise.

I looked online to find options for storing and collecting data on Unity. I found a few files formats, such as Jason or xml but thee not as secure and can be changed really easily. The other option I found was binary files, which is secure, but that dose means the file can only be read through the Unity once’s it has been decrypted.

As such a format file might be the option to use at the time bearing, but still look around if I can find nether options.  

## Week five

I read the two other papers I found to get more inflation in the subject I’m investigating.

The Papp ‘BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with abnormal interhemispheric transfer of a newly acquired motor skill’ mention as time passes the more motor training that is taken part in, less mental possessing is done, and it became more reflexive overtime. The two groups they used to conduct the if motor skill can be improved with reptation showed that eventually both group’s motors skill levels managed to be at the same level when it came to small tasks.

 The paper mentions that as the testers dormant is always motor leering they had less proboles with the test then with their other hand, which led to the testers using more mental possessing compared to their dormant hand. The papa ere dose say that the skills acquired from doing the specific test does not mean that the skills will transferer to otherer tasks, if there where to transfuse it would still take some time to reach the same level rate.

The papa per did tall about how different sex could have a effect on how motor skill leering could dirtier, however with the gathered participants they had it was difficult to deduce if that could be a possibility.

This paperer testing process is similar to the test I’m trying conduct; both have areas pf getting information through key press and as sequential patterns and have some randomised sections; however, the approach is slightly applied differently. Conacring how this was taken place maybe the test I’m conducting might need to slight change to get better results.

“Neurophysiological Mechanisms Involved in Transfer of Procedural Knowledge”

I found and read a paper on hand-to-hand transfer skills through reptation with inputting data using keys, to better understand and consider possible factors regarding my test.

The paper ‘had Neurophysiological Mechanisms Involved in Transfer of Procedural Knowledge’ studied that if training with one hand would lead to collected inflation witch then can be transferred to the other hand and thus leading improvements to both hands through repeated motor leering.

Even though this paper says the motor skill inflation can be transferred between hands but only after training, given how my test is also related to get information from inputted keys I should restrict the users to their dominant hand to get the best possible information and also means that the other hand doesn’t need taken in account of in any of results.

I created a reop on github to store the Unity game for this project. I downloaded the stammered assets pack from Unity that as some 2d assets I can use in the game. I built a simple scene to test the assets.
